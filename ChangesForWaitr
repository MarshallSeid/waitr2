Can use UCSD Login 
Logo too large
Some buttons were unclear (Description - Goody's)

Postits
	Make images consistent - logo vs real picture
	Make the icon clickable + 2
	Fonts and selectors are very small - back button and help button would be very helpful
		Map for places to eat will be very helpful
	Use "window.history.Back()" for javascript that bring  user to previous page
	Bigger tetx for food and drink selector
	dont forget to bootstrap your images to make them more responsive
	Consistent mainpage button widths would be nice
	There are unclear actions
